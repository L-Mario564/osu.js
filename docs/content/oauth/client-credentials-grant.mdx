# Client credentials grant

Provides an OAuth token with no user associated with it, sort of like a "guest token". To get this token, make a `POST` request to `https://osu.ppy.sh/oauth/token`. You can do so with the `clientCredentialsGrant` method.

```ts
const token = await auth.clientCredentialsGrant();
```

## Returns

```ts
Promise<GuestToken>;
```

### Types

- [GuestToken](/references/guest-token)
