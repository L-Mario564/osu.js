An unofficial Javascript and Typescript SDK for the browser-facing portion of osu! with type safety in mind.

# npm
npm i osu-web.js
# yarn
yarn add osu-web.js
# pnpm
pnpm add osu-web.js
```

## Coverage

osu.js has 100% coverage over the legacy API.

For the current API, all documented endpoints with a `GET` request have been implemented and tested. All endpoints with `POST` and `PATCH` requests have been implemented, but most aren't tested. None of the undocumented endpoints have been implemented.

The current API is up to date with February 17th, 2023's (2023-02-17) [breaking changes](https://osu.ppy.sh/docs/index.html#breaking-changes).
